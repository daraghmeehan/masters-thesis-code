# Learning Multiple Languages Through Parallel Audiovisual Input

This repository contains the computer program I created for the study of multiple languages simultaneously from audiovisual input (TV shows/movies) as part of my Master's Thesis at Charles University and the University of Groningen.

My program takes video files with multiple language audio tracks and corresponding subtitle files.
It breaks the file down into sections and displays the subtitles in a multilingual reader.

It's possible to create multimedia flashcards with vocabulary/phrases, that can be imported in Anki.
It's also possible to create condensed review audio files, which extract all dialogue audio from the episode (using the subtitle timings), with the option of cycling through languages for each dialogue or playing the whole episode back-to-back in different languages.
